## Meeting Logistics

The JupyterHub team will be providing a technical tutorial of JupyterHub this
**Friday, January 27, 10:00-11:30 am Pacific Time**.

The goal of the tutorial is to provide Jupyter developers (especially the day-to-day team)
with a solid technical overview of the JupyterHub architecture. Members of the community
are welcome to join us online, though please note that, unfortunately, we will have limited seats.
If you do join us and have questions about deploying JupyterHub as an end user, please ask those
questions toward the end of the tutorial Discussion + Q & A or (better yet!) on the mailing list.
We'll record the session and make it available shortly afterwards so that all members of the
community can view it on demand.
